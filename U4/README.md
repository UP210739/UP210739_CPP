# Execution instructions
<br>

### Instructions for Windows 

1. Download or clone my repo with the following command in the terminal:
   
```
"git clone https://github.com/UP210739/UP210739_CPP.git"
```

2. Download and install the compiler in this link https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/OldFiles/ 
3. Open the terminal at the direction of the file with the command:

```
cd C:\Documents\...
```

4. To compile use command:

```
gcc  04_Connect4.cpp -o 04_Connect4.exe
```

5. To run type this code:

```
04_Connect4.exe
```
<br>

### Instructions for Linux 

1. Download or clone my repo with the following command in the terminal:
   
```
"git clone https://github.com/UP210739/UP210739_CPP.git"
```

2. Install GNU c/c++ compiler, open the terminal and type:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential manpages-dev
```

3. To compile this program, type:

```
gcc 04_Connect4.c -o 04_Connect4
```

4. To run this program, type:
   
```
./04_Connect4
```
<br>

### Use and general considerations
When you start the program, the home screen will be displayed and you will be asked to enter the name of the players.
<br>

The board will then be displayed and you will be asked to enter a number from 1 to 7 indicating the column you want to place the token in.
<br>

If you select an entire column, it will ask you to select a number again.
When any player wins, the game ends and it will ask you if you want to play.

# Conclusion
<br>

With this project we completed unit 4 of the 3er quarter, we learned many new functions and codes that were used in every project that was done in the quarter. Everything we learned will be of great help for future work. In this project there were many complications as for example when making the table of the connecting 4, there were also complications when moving the texts to the side of the table but it was possible to reach the desired project. Thank you our master for having
